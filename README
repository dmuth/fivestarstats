Welcome to the Fivestar Stats module!

I wrote this module to scratch an itch of mine: I wanted a way to get voting
stats, and also to catch abuses of the voting system (a single user 
consistently voting down another user, etc.)


Right now, this module does the following:

- Gets total vote stats, including the average rating

- Tells what IP addresses:
	- Are top voters
	- Are top 1-star voters (to catch abuse)
	- Have the lowest vote average. (generally mean people)

- Tells what users:
	- Have the highest average rating
	- Have the lowest average rating
	- Have had the most 1-star votes cast against them (to catch abuse)


Things it does not do:

- User ratings.  I may implment that some day.

- Configuration via the web UI.  Right now, the number of top users/votes/etc. 
are hard coded.
